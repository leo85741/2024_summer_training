An atheist does not\\nbelieve in the existence of a god.  Our opinions on issues such as \\ncapital punishment and abortion, however, vary greatly.  \\n\\nIf you were attacking the views of a particular atheist (Benedikt, I \\npresume), then please present your argument as such and do not lump us\\nall together.\\n\\nAs for the issues, let\\'s start with abortion.  Personally, I do not support\\nabortion as a means of population control or contraception-after-the-fact.\\nHowever, I support the right of any woman to have an abortion, regardless\\nof what my personal views may be, because it would be arrogant of me to tell\\nany individual what he/she may or may not do to his/her body, and the domain\\nof legislators should not extend into the uterus.  That\\'s my opinion, and I\\nam sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me.\\n\\nI do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control, but I \\ncertainly defend it as an end to itself.  I think most homosexuals would\\nbe angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship as\\nnothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down.  \\n\\nAs for atheists believing all values are biological, I have no idea what\\nyou\\'re talking about.\\n\\nFinally, there are the issues of war and capital punishment.  An atheist\\ncan object to either one just as easily as a theist might.  You seem to\\nbe hung up on some supposed conspiratorial link between atheism and \\npopulation control.  Could this be the \"atheist cause\" you were referring \\nto a few posts back?\\n\\n-- \\n---                      __  _______                              ---\\n||| Kevin Marshall       \\\\ \\\\/ /_  _/  Computer Science Department |||\\n||| Virginia Tech         \\\\  / / /     marshall@csugrad.cs.vt.edu |||\\n--- Blacksburg, Virginia   \\\\/ /_/                  (703) 232-6529 ---\\n',\n",

When you say (paraphrased)\\n#in (2) that this is not \"evidence for [benefactor]\", for example, what you\\n#mean is that it\\'s no *more* evidence for [benefactor] than it is for [bug].\\n\\nYes, that\\'s what I mean.\\n\\n#In (3), however, you\\'ve shifted the meaning of \"evidence for [benefactor]\"\\n#so that it now means `absolute\\' \"evidence for [benefactor]\" rather than\\n#`relative\\' \"evidence for [benefactor]\" w.r.t. [bug].\\n\\nNot really, I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other.  I\\nthink this is just a communications problem.   What I am trying to say,\\nin my clumsy way, is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates\\nto theism making predictions (prayer, your \\'Rapture\\' example), I don\\'t\\nbuy your use of Occam\\'s razor in all cases where A=0.\\n\\nIn my example, one couldn\\'t dismiss\\n[benefactor] or [bug] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary\\nto explain the dosh.  I brought up the \\'one-by-one dismissal\\' process to\\nshow that it would be wrong to do so.  From what you\\'re saying in this\\npost, it seems you agree, and we\\'re talking at cross-purposes.\\n\\n#(3) is still in contradiction to (1).\\n#\\n#Some sums may help. With B = benefactor, b = bug, d = dosh arrives in account:\\n#\\n#  (1) implies  P(B+b | d) = 1\\n#\\n#Assuming that P(Bb | d) = 0, so it\\'s either the benefactor *or* a bug\\n#which is responsible if the bucks arrive, but not both, then\\n#\\n#   P(B+b | d)   =   P(B | d) + P(b | d)\\n#\\n#so\\n#\\n#   P(B | d) + P(b | d)  =  1\\n#\\n#but (3) implies that\\n#\\n#   P(B | d)  =  0  and  P(b | d)  =  0.\\n\\nNo, this isn\\'t what I meant.  P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5, with\\nnecessarily no new observation (we\\'ve already seen the dosh) to change\\nthose estimates.  I was trying to say (again, in my clumsy way) that\\nit would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  And that\\'s\\nprecisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are\\none class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of\\nhypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise \\nwould _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  It can be thrown out or\\nretained on grounds of non-rational preference, not of science or statistics.   \\nAlternatively, one could chuck out or retain the lot, on the grounds\\nthat the answer can\\'t be known, or that the notional probability estimates\\nare effectively useless, being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).\\n\\n#> As they do when the set M is filled by \"the universe is caused by x\",\\n#> where x is gods, pink unicorns, nothing, etc.  - and no observation\\n#> tends to one conclusion over the other.\\n#\\n#Exactly the point I was making, I think. So we don\\'t \"throw out\" any of\\n#these, contrary to your assertion above that we do.\\n\\nSome people do, Simon, and they think they are doing excellent science.\\nMy sole point was that they aren\\'t.\\n\\n#>> Only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis H[i] (i.e. x\\n#>> where P(x | H[i]) = 0) can cause P(H[i]) to go to zero after a finite\\n#>> number of observations.

See my post on the other branch of this\\n#thread.\\n\\nThen you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  If\\nthe razor holds for gods, then it holds for all like hypotheses.  Which\\nmeans that you\\'re assigning P(x | H[i]) =0 for all i, though we\\'ve already\\nestablished that it\\'s not correct to do so when SUM(P(x|H[i]))=1 over\\nall i.\\n\\n#> Simply put, anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or\\n#> non-existence of gods, whether inductive or no, is at best mistaken, and\\n#> at worst barking mad.\\n#\\n#Luckily I make no such claim, and have specifically said as much on numerous\\n#occasions. You wouldn\\'t be constructing a strawman here, would you Frank?\\n#Although that doesn\\'t, of course, rule out my being barking mad in any case\\n#(I could be barking mad in my spare time, with apologies to Cleese et al).\\n#\\n#But I think you miss the point once again. When I say that something is\\n#\"evidence against\" an hypothesis, that doesn\\'t imply that observation of\\n#the said something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis, reducing the\\n#estimate of P(H | data) to zero. If it *reduces* this quantity, it\\'s still\\n#evidence against H.\\n\\nNo, I got that.  I\\'m talking about the case when A=0.  You\\'re clearly\\ncorrect when A!=0.   And I\\'m not constructing a strawman (though it\\'s\\ncertainly possible that I\\'ve misunderstood what you\\'re saying).  However,\\nby any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely,\\nand when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purporting\\nto be an inductive proof that gods either don\\'t exist, or are unnecessary\\nto explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience, systems such as this\\n(including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain\\na fallacy upon close examination.

No one has ever found any metal swords or\\n>and traces of a civilization other than the Native Americans.\\n>\\n>This is just one example.\\n\\nFrom _Free Inquiry_, Winter 83/84,  the following is an\\nintroduction to the article \"Joseph Smith and the Book of\\nMormon\", by George D. Smith.  The introduction is written by\\nPaul Kurtz. \\n\\n\\tMormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\n\\t-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  It is one of\\n\\tthe world\\'s fastest growing religions, with as many as\\n\\t200,000 new converst in 1982 alone.  Because of the church\\'s\\n\\taggressive missionary program, covering more than one\\n\\thundred countries, it is spreading even to third world\\n\\tcountries.\\n\\t\\n\\tMormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and\\n\\tevangelical in preachment.  The church is run along strict\\n\\tauthoritarian lines.  Led by a president, who allegedly\\n\\treceives revelations directly form God, and a group of\\n\\ttwelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief\\n\\tand practice, the church is opposed to abortion,\\n\\tpornography, sexual freedom, women\\'s rights, and other, in\\n\\tits view, immoral influences of secular society, and it\\n\\tforbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea.\\n\\t\\n\\tCentered in Salt Lake City, the church is extremely wealthy\\n\\tand politically powerful in Utal and many other western\\n\\tstates.  Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft\\n\\tBenson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family,\\n\\tthe Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed\\n\\tgovernment officials.\\n\\t\\n\\tThe Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by\\n\\tJoseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had\\n\\tfound gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill\\n\\tand that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he\\n\\thad been able to translate the writing into the _Book of\\n\\tMormon_, the basis of Mormon belief.  This book, written \"by\\n\\tthe commandment of God,\" claims that the ancient Hebrews\\n\\tsettled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors\\n\\tof the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those who\\n\\thave been baptized in the \"true church\" will be reunited\\n\\tafter death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can\\n\\tbe baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the\\n\\thereafter.  Because of these beliefs, Mormons have been\\n\\tconsidered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and\\n\\tas heretics by religious fundamentalists.\\n\\t\\n\\tJoseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was\\n\\tboth worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Because\\n\\tof persecution he led his band of loyal followers from\\n\\tPalmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois,\\n\\twhere in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  Brigham\\n\\tYoung, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over\\n\\tthe leadership of the church and led the Mormons further\\n\\twestward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City. \\n\\tFollowing the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of\\n\\tpolygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice\\n\\tin nineteenth-century America.\\n\\t\\n\\tWhile other religions go back many centuries --\\n\\tMuhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism,\\n\\t3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are\\n\\tdifficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormon\\n\\troots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine this\\n\\thistory objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny\\n\\tis dangerous to the faith.\\n\\t\\n\\tIn the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles\\n\\tabout the Mormon church.  First, George D. Smith, a lifelong\\n\\tmember of the church, provides a detailed critical\\n\\texamination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of\\n\\tMormon_ was divinely revealed.  Second, we present a portion\\n\\tof an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin, also a\\n\\tMormon since birth, who questions the treatment of the\\n\\thistory of the church by Mormon authorities. -- Paul Kurtz\\n\\t\\n\\nThe article itself is super.\\n\\n  ,...,.,,\\n /666;    \\',    \\n////;    _~ -   \\n(/@/----0-~-0\\n ;\\'  . `` ~ \\\\\\'\\n  , `    \\' , >\\n;;|\\\\..((   -C---->> jimtims p00168@psilink.com \\n;;| >-  `.__),;;\\n\\n',\n",

Brown Associates.\\n\\n------\\n\\nDenali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics\\nsubsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use\\na parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both\\nhave a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of\\npixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly\\nin performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have \\nsimilar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market\\npenetration.\\n\\nThere remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and\\nE&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end\\ndeveloper's dream system with plenty of performance potential and\\nflexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to\\nsixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at\\na higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom\\nsystems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that\\nsupport a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom\\ndesign treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing\\ndevelopers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose\\napplications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and\\nvideo integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note\\nthat KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not\\nrequire an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,\\nhowever, will remain much more flexible.\\n\\nThe KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.\\nEntry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end\\nFreedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price\\npoints.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because\\nit uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting\\nin better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide\\nstrong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that\\nnot all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's\\nconfiguration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase\\ngeometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade\\nthem separately as needed.\\n\\nBoth companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at\\nworkstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive\\nVGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide\\nthis capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation\\nof textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher\\nqualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali\\nprovideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.\\nAside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism\\nfor texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics\\ndata storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation\\nmodules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels\\nto obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking\\ntexturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable\\nsolution.\\n\\nHope this helps,\\n\\nBrian\\n\\nPS This was reprinted without permission.

Also I use\\nStacker on the primary drive, HP Newwave (for my wife\\'s use, and she \\nwon\\'t let me get rid of it!), and a product called Infinite Disk from \\nChili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom \\nused offline files.  \\n\\nI plan to upgrade to NT, when it becomes a released product.  I was stongly\\ntempted to become a beta user early on, but I don\\'t have time to mess around\\nwith the hassles of beta software.  I expect to buy it, tear off the \\nshrink wrap, and use it without hassle (I know, unrealistic, but I can\\nhope can\\'t I, after all, I have work to do).\\n\\nThe advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers, and \\nhardware specific stuff in general.  How smoothly can I expect the \\nupgrade to go?  Can I expect support for all my stuff, or do I\\nstill need to scramble around downloading drivers (PAS?, Orchid?, Colorado?) \\nfrom some bbs, etc.  What steps should I take to ensure the installation\\ngoes smoothly.  Note that I want to nuke dos totally from the system.  I\\'m\\nallergic to command lines!  I plan to run a \"pure\" NT system.  Also, will \\nNT communicate with the workgroups lan?  What about stacker?  I currently \\nhave stacker on the first disk drive.  Without Stacker, and the Infinite \\nDisk product, I will have great difficulty fitting everything I have on the \\nsystem (It\\'s cramped now).\\n\\nI realize Stacker will be incompatible with NT, but will there be an NT \\nversion?  Or will NT support compression a la Dos 6?  I know Infinite Disk\\nwill be incompatible with NT, but will they offer (or does anybody else)\\na comparable product for NT and at what cost?  (perhaps I need to ask \\nChili Pepper that question)  I can live without ID if I have to, but I\\'d\\nrather not.  Will NT run my DOS apps (the teletext board mainly) without\\nDOS on the system?  What do I need to keep around?\\n\\nAny feedback or advice (including \"forget NT\" with good reasons) is much\\nappreciated.  My only significant reason for moving to NT is I need a better\\nmultitasking environment than Windows (among other reasons, WAVE locks up\\nthe machine for hours and hours doing DSP processing on large audio files),\\nand I want better lan support than I now have (Internet access, etc).  Maybe\\nthere are better solutions than NT and if so, I would appreciate hearing \\nabout them (OS/2?

If your\\nIDE drive does not have a label, then you can look for a polarization notch in\\nthe receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacle\\nis center polarized, that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide\\npositioned in the center of one side, then you can identify pin 1 as follows:\\nlook into the pins with the notch at the top, pin 1 is at the top right.  On\\nall drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pin\\nis pin 1 on the controller, well you can use the same criteria but look hard\\nfor the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins\\n39 & 40 (the oposite end), then you are all set.  All you need to do is keep\\nthe pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don\\'t even have to look at the\\ncable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually the\\npin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).  But\\nbeware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables\\nwith pin 40 being the one marked red.  Of course with non-polarized connectors\\nthis doesn\\'t matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide\\nwhich side is pin 1.\\n\\n: Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.\\n: I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into\\n: the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the \"master\" drive\\n: and which into the \"Slave\"?  any help appreciated.  thanks...\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drives\\nare jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you\\nshould be concerned with on BOTH drives.

You will have to consult the \\ndocuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation,\\nthen just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have\\none.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like\\nyourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.

I'm\\nprimarily looking at 128MB drives, although I might consider 256MB ones.\\n\\nWhen looking through MacWorld and MacUser ads, the prices for the 128MB drives\\nseem to range from just under $1000 (for the DGR 128REM Portable, Magic 128MB\\nPortable Fujitsu, or NuDesign 128MB from MacDirect) to about $1600 (for the\\nFWB HammerDisk 130 and Mass Microsystems DataPak MO/128).  Different drives\\nuse different mechanisms - MOST, Fujitsu, Sony, Epson, probably some others.\\n\\nMy problem is that after reading the Nov 92 MacWorld and Apr 93 MacUser\\nreviews of these drives, I'm still not sure what to get.  So, I'm asking\\nif anyone has had good/bad experiences with any 128MB M-O drive or can shed\\nsome light on the wide range of prices (is spending more really buying me\\nmuch?), reliability of different drives, compatibility between them, or \\nanything else I should probably know.\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\n\\tJohn Sasinowski\\n\\n\",\n",

I love the Mac interface and any number\\nof the features, but am sorely dissapointed with the speed. I use macs daily\\nand am a Moc consultant for OSU Statistics department; I\\'m familiar with almost\\nevery model out there, and my experience is that both the Amiga and the Atari\\nST simply \"blow the Mac out of the water\" in terms of performance. At this time\\nI would in general say that the other advantages of the Mac outweigh the\\nadvantages of the Amiga or the ST (and Falcon), but I really wish Apple would\\nget their heads together on speed... :-((((( They could take a real lesson in\\nmuli-tasking from the Amiga OS or the MultiTOS in the Atari Falcons too :-(((\\n\\n > I\\'m still happy with my ci, but I don\\'t understand why the performance is\\n> so bad (comparatively).

If I had my choice, I would go with Mac in most aspects, but add the\\nspeed and superior Multi-Tasking of the other platforms.\\n\\nAs for the original topic; Trying to compare *just the chip* in a machine seems\\nalmost worthless. A fast 386 with a wiz-bang graphics accelerator will be\\nfaster in productivity for many applications than a even a stock Quadra. Add a\\ngraphics accelerator to a 486 and you *really fly*.

However, this digitiser makes use of the serial\\nport, so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver.\\n\\nThe HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input from\\ndevices listed in the /usr/lib/X11/X*devices file (* = display number).\\nI shouldn't think I would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an input\\ndevice in this file and expect a digitiser to work.  But maybe I'm wrong.  Am I?\\n\\nWhat I would like to know is: does anybody out there have a digitiser connected\\nto their workstation for use as a pointer for X (rather than just as input to a\\nspecific X application)?  If so, what were the steps required for installation?\\nDid you need a special device driver?  Did the manufacturer supply it?  Are\\nthere generic public domain device drivers around?

Basically you change the TERM environment variable before the\\n  actual call to rlogin is performed, to include your DISPLAY and your\\n  authorization.\\n    On the remote machine you then extract this information and return the\\n  TERM environment variable to normal BEFORE you use it for reseting or\\n  stty\\'ing your terminal.\\n\\n  ---8<---\\n  script for launching rlogin:\\n    #!/bin/sh\\n    # ~/bin/rl   --- Rlogin with display:\\n    if [ -n \"$DISPLAY\" ]; then\\n      case \"$DISPLAY\" in\\n        :*) DISPLAY=`hostname`$DISPLAY ;;\\n      esac\\n      TERM=\"$TERM&$DISPLAY&`xauth nextract - $DISPLAY`\"\\n      export TERM\\n    fi\\n    rlogin $*\\n  ---8<---\\n  add to your .cshrc or .login\\n    if ( $?TERM ) then\\n      if ( `echo $TERM | tr -cd \\'&\\'` != \\'\\' ) then\\n        echo \"$TERM\" | cut \\'-d&\\' -f3 | xauth nmerge -\\n        setenv DISPLAY `echo \"$TERM\" | cut \\'-d&\\' -f2`\\n        setenv TERM    `echo \"$TERM\" | cut \\'-d&\\' -f1`\\n      endif\\n    endif\\n  ---8<---\\n  xterm command to use\\n    xterm -T hostname -e ~/bin/rl hostname\\n  ---8<---\\n\\n3/ NFS.\\n     Write it to a file on a shared NFS partition you have access to.\\n   Note that if the home directories are NFS mounted, then authorization\\n   is automatically passed, Hoever you will still have to pass your\\n   DISPLAY environment variable via a file or other means.

Thus requiring a encryption method that is uniq to each\\n  individual.  IE: the method of decyrption must not be shared or known\\n  by others, nor should it be easy to determine.\\n    A improvment is to use the `who fingered me\\' technique to only give\\n  the information only to your own remote accounts and not just to anyone\\n  who is asking.\\n    This last method was developed last year by a second year here, untill\\n  I explained to him the need for the encryption, at which point he gave\\n  up this method.

Only one other player since Ruth attained that mark: Cal\\nRipken for his 1984 season. Rounding out the top five offensive players\\nin the NL last season: Sheffield, 5.9; Sandberg, 5.8; Van Slyke, 5.3; and\\nLarkin, 4.7.\\n\\nThe top 5 offensive players in the AL in 1992 were: E. Martinez, 4.8;\\nVentura, 4.8; Anderson, 4.5; R. Henderson, 4.4; and Thomas, 4.4\\n\\nIn short, Total Baseball says Bonds enjoyed one of the best seasons\\never in the game's history -- better than any year had by Mantle,\\nMays, Williams, etc. (If you disagree, don't flame me; flame the\\nwriters of Total Baseball.) Also, Martinez and Ventura are neck and\\nneck, so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis, which one\\nhad the better year can be considered a toss-up. Thus, Total Baseball\\nsupports your choices of Bonds and Ventura as the MVPs of 1992.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\n--------------------------\\nPhil Brown                |\\naka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |\\n--------------------------\\n\",\n",

Thus, if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned\\nrun, his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs, thus his ERA\\nis 3.00.

I used to think this was true, but more and more I\\'m becoming\\nconvinced that it\\'s the other way around: among players with the physical\\nability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get the\\nchance to do it a lot.\\n\\nLet\\'s break down the four basic categories of hitter, according to whether\\nthey are power threats and whether they walk a lot:\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tPower\\t\\t\\tNo Power\\n\\n\\tPatient\\t\\tFrank Thomas\\t\\tBrett Butler\\n\\t\\t\\tBarry Bonds\\t\\tOzzie Smith\\n\\t\\t\\tMark McGwire\\t\\tCraig Grebeck\\n\\t\\t\\tBabe Ruth\\t\\tMiller Huggins\\n\\t\\t\\tTed Williams\\t\\tBilly Hamilton\\n\\t\\t\\tRickey Henderson\\tEddie Joost\\n\\t\\t\\tJoe Morgan\\t\\tMike Hargrove\\n\\t\\t\\t   .\\t\\t\\t   .\\n\\t\\t\\t   .\\t\\t\\t   .\\n\\t\\t\\t   .\\t\\t\\t   .\\n\\n\\tImpatient\\tErnie Banks\\t\\tOzzie Guillen\\n\\t\\t\\tDave Kingman\\t\\tShawon Dunston\\n\\t\\t\\tJoe Carter\\t\\tAndres Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tGeorge Bell\\t\\tJose Lind\\n\\t\\t\\tKirby Puckett\\t\\tDevon White\\n\\tetc.\\n\\nAs far as I can tell, all the categories are full.  It really looks like the\\ntwo are independent.  Nobody could possibly be *afraid* of Craig Grebeck at\\nthe plate, and yet he walks quite a lot.  Part of that, undoubtedly, is being\\nsmall of stature, but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of \\ntarget at least 3 times out of 6.  Randy Milligan is an even better example;\\nhe\\'s only shown noticeable power for one (partial) season, but he walks all\\nover the place, despite his huge strike zone.\\n\\n\\n-- \\n   David M.

His\\n1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B.  The move to\\nthird base explains a lot of his 1989.  When he returned as an OF,\\nhe began hitting again.  And of course, last year he slumped.\\n\\nBut no learning curve?  He has obviously improved his batting eye\\nover the years, as well as his SB/CS ratio.  As to his fielding,\\nhe was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he came\\nup through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through\\n2 position changes in the space of a year.  He\\'s an adequate OF,\\nalthough not great, and at least some of your perception of his\\nfielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the\\nML level.  (I know you\\'re another long-term Braves fan :)\\n\\nAbout playing 3B...IMO, that\\'s the 2nd most DIFFICULT position\\nto field, after catcher.  At SS or 2B, you need more range and \\nspeed, but at 3B, you\\'ve got to have quick reflexes and have \\na GUN for an arm.  There are NO second chances at 3B, even when\\nplaying sandlot softball!  Granted, I\\'d still put my best\\noverall infielder at SS, but that\\'s because he gets more\\nchances, not because the job is harder.  It still amazes me\\nthat so many teams have tried to convert other position players\\nto 3B.  But maybe that\\'s because the supply of \"natural\" 3B is\\nscarce.\\n\\nFinally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to\\nperform well, and works hard to improve.  You don\\'t get\\nthose amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a\\nlot of weight work.  Now, whether he\\'s been overdoing it these\\ndays may be a valid question, as is the question of whether\\nhe tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat.\\nBut frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential,\\nI\\'d much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not\\ntrying hard enough.  You might be able to teach relaxation\\nto an adult; but at that age I don\\'t believe you can teach\\nhustle.\\n\\nAll that said, I don\\'t think I\\'d sign Gant to another long-term\\ncontract.  He\\'s 28 now, and I think he\\'s free-agent eligible\\nin 2 years, when he\\'ll be 30.  Given his career curve and\\nlimitations, I wouldn\\'t expect him to last much past 35\\nas a ML ballplayer.

The Jets\\nlooked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the \\nnumbers that counted: goals.\\n\\tVancouver's big line produced again, with centre Cliff Ronning and\\nleft winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to \\nboost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of\\nBautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent\\nin opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals.\\n\\tHowever, as in the first game, the Jets worked hard to take the\\ngame to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second,\\nchecking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged\\nby a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. \\n\\tThe hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caught\\nVancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make\\nthe score 2-1. \\n\\tDomi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush\\nto the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do \\nanything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were\\nallowed to set up and make plays.\\n\\tBoth goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably.\\nMcLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne\\nwhile Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous\\non the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck\\nzone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four\\nchecking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead.\\n\\tA series of minor penalties at the end of the second period\\nresulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The\\nJet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's\\nlegs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2.\\n\\tThe Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off.\\nThis was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected\\nor were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight\\nWinnipeg defence that were never supported.\\n\\tHowever, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive\\nlapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff\\nin the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with\\nno Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the\\ngame up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a \\nbackhand even though he was off balance. \\n\\tBy then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it\\nto the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing\\nfor their attack.

The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald\\n was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy\\n to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed\\n on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest\\n periods I've seen Sweden play this year.\\n Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many\\n times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial\\n save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal\\n from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way\\n to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a\\n nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4\\n just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of\\n the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole. \\n Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled\\n through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes,\\n Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close\\n range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away,\\n and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom.\\n\\n Switzerland:\\n\\n Goaltender:  20 Reto Pavoni  (28 Renatio Tosio)\\n Defense:     26 Rick Tschumi, 2 Martin Steinegger\\n              16 Sven Leuenberger, 5 Martin Rauch\\n               7 Sandro Bertaggia, 17 Patrick Sutter\\n              31 Samuel Balmer\\n Forwards:    22 Alfred Luthi, 11 Felix Hollenstein, 25 Roman Waeger\\n              23 Gil Montandon, 12 Roberto Triulzi, 10 Patrick Howald\\n              35 Christian Weber, 18 Andreas Ton, 24 Joerg Eberle\\n              15 Bruno Erni, 13 Thomas Vrabec, 29 Manuele Celio\\n \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n RUSSIA - CANADA  1-3 (0-2,1-1,0-0)\\n\\n 1st: CAN 0-1 Kevin Dineen 1     (Garry Galley)                       4:28\\n      CAN 0-2 Paul Kariya 2      (Eric Lindros)                      12:20 (pp)\\n 2nd: CAN 0-3 Eric Lindros 10    (Paul Kariya,Shayne Corson)          9:40\\n      RUS 1-3 Valeri Karpov 2    (?)                                 16:24\\n 3rd:\\n\\n Penalties: RUS 2*2min 1*5min, CAN 5*2min\\n Referee: Anton Danko, Czech republic\\n Attendance: 8,600\\n\\n Russia probably made their best game of the tourney, but yet there wasn't\\n enough to win against the effective Canadians.\\n\\n Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just\\n deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play\\n goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the\\n far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov.\\n Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of\\n the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score.\\n Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya\\n entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman,\\n then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to\\n deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck.\\n The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side\\n and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner.\\n \\n Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri\\n Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and\\n in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes,\\n and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros\\n after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period.\\n\\n Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game,\\n 7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player\\n (among those Kariya with 1+6).

       " \"Subject: Flames Final Stats and Playoff News\\nFrom: caldwell8102@mtroyal.ab.ca\\nOrganization: Mount Royal College, Calgary, Alberta\\nLines: 118\\n\\nNews:\\n=====\\nFor the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player\\nremaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not \\na major part of the team. \\n\\nTrent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season\\ngame against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has\\nalso scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. \\n\\nThoughts on Game 1:\\n==================\\n\\nThe Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with\\nLos Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing\\nbig hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that\\nwas the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and \\ntry and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky\\nKings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames\\nconducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren\\nFleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren\\nRychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. \\n\\nGoaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the\\nloss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got\\nvery little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and \\nsweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off\\nChris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. \\n\\nThoughts on Game 2:\\n==================\\n\\nThe Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the\\npotentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.\\nThe first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary\\ncame out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring\\nfive goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. \\n\\nThe deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary\\ndominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better\\nuse of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary\\nalso went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up\\na shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the\\ngame with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when\\nthey needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. \\n\\nThe Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he\\nwas leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie\\nHuddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. \\n\\nThe game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of\\nCalgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for\\ninstigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato\\ndrew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed\\n30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct\\nfor hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a\\nfight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and\\nYawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil \\nturtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at \\neach other was just roughing?

How many times\\nhave they done that in their history?\\n\\n1985 up 2-0 in a five game series against the Isles, lost 3 straight\\n1987 up 3-1 against the Isles, lost 3 straight\\n1992 up 3-1 against the Pens, lost 3 straight\\n\\nIn other words, when they were about to clinch with 3 games to go, they \\nwere a pitiful 2-9, the lone wins being \\n\\n1) a sweep of Philly in 1984\\n2) the 1990 win against the Rangers in the Patrick finals, the ONLY TIME \\nthey managed to get out of the division.\\n\\nActually, Saturday\\'s blown lead wasn\\'t anything new. We all know the Caps\\nare famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games. Examples:\\n\\n1) game 4 against the Isles, 1985, led 4-2 after two, lead series 2-1,\\ngave up 4 goals in the 3rd period, including the game winning goal in the\\nlast minute. After that goal, Bobby Carpenter botched a penalty shot.\\nSeries tied 2-2, lost game 5 a few days later.\\n\\n2) game 4 against the Rangers, 1986, led series 2-1, led by 2 in the 3rd \\nperiod, blew it. Lost game in OT and three consecutive games.\\n\\n3) game 6 against Pittsurgh, 1992, led series 3-2, led by 2 in 2nd period.\\nBlew it and the series.\\n\\n4) game 3 against Isles, 1993, series tied 1-1, led by 2 after 2. Blew it.\\n\\n5) game 4 against Isles, 1993, trailed series 2-1, led by 3 in 2nd period.\\nBlew it again.\\n\\nWhen they were leading by 3 in game 4, I said to myself: \"if they blew this\\nlead, the series is OVER\". They have lost all the momemtum. The Islanders\\nbelieve they can come back no matter what the score is.\\n\\nI am still waiting for a Cap goalie who can carry the team, who can \\ncompletely shut down the opposition when they are hanging on their dear \\nlives in a crucial game.\\n\\n>The Admiral, a hopeless Caps fan.\\n>P.S. We still remember that 3 OT loss to the Islanders! Aurggghhhhhhhhh!\\nWell, some teams such have it and some teams just don\\'t. When the Caps\\nwere frustrated year in year out by the Islanders, I was thinking \"wait\\nuntil Potvin/Bossy/Trottier/Smith retire\". Well, they retired (even though\\nTrottier was still able to haunt the Caps on a Pens uniform), yet another\\ngeneration of Islanders were still doing the same thing.

First, the trend toward universal\\nidentifiers  is  as  much.-a  movement  generated  by  government  or\\nindustry\\'s desire to keep track of all citizens as it is by\\ncitizens seeking simplicity and convenience in all transactions.\\nAt best,  your  system  would  benefit  the  sophisticated  and  most\\nwould opt for  simplicity.

The garage is Unheated.  \\nThey were left in their places that they needed to be.  One in the riding\\nlawnmower (what a lux) and one in each motorcycle.  The battery in the \\nriding lawnmower was about 3-4 years old, and one of the cycle batteries \\nwas new, and one was around 5 years old.  Upon spring time, I discovered\\nthat all of the batteries were dead, and needed to be recharged.  They all\\nworked properly, except for the older ones, and they had to be replaced \\nabout halfway through the summer.  (they had originally been stored\\nin the garage, and I think I remember my dad charging them in spring)\\n  Last year, I decided to bring them in to the basement, which has two parts.\\none is dirt and brick, and the other is concrete.  I brought in all three, and\\ndiscovered in the spring, (about 15 days ago) that not only were the batteries\\ndead, but when I put the charger on them, the charger said \"HMMMMMMMM\" and \\nthe amp-meter read around 1,000,000,000  (In other words, it was pinned)\\nthe internal circut tripped, and I went on to the other batteries.  They\\nwere the same.  \\n   Realizing that we still had 2 GIGANTIC sailboat batteries, also lead\\nacid, I decided to put the charger on them.  (these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years, on the brick and dirt part) and noticed that they only\\nneeded a small charge, around 2 hours or so on trickle.  I tested them\\nby using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts, and they\\nworked fine for around 25 of \\'em. \\n  This leads me to believe one of several things.\\n     1) I bought really #$%tty batteries last year. (sorta true)\\n     2) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the\\n        batteries.\\n     3) There was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the \\n          room where the concrete is, \\n     4) The dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air\\n         better than concrete.\\n\\n(BTW, I can almost waterski in the dirt room)  \\n\\n   Any other ideas?\\n    *could be the aliens, anything is possible.*\\n \\n',\n",

It's called RADAR.\\nWell, actually not quite. Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances\\nby measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive its\\nreflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimeters\\nuse either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case of\\nthe latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example,\\nthe original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500\\nfeet altitude.\\n\\nNote, however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster\\noriginally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements between\\na transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate\\ntime base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter\\ntriggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actually\\ntravel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the difference\\nis called the velocity factor of the cable). So you need to resort to a\\ncommon timebase that is automatically corrected for distance, etc. Something\\nlike a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick, triggering both\\nthe transmitter and receiver simultaneously. Sound expensive? Not too bad,\\nbut plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort.\\n\\nWhy not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where again\\nthe reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E.\\nshould know about anyway ;-).\\n\\n>> Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength\\n>> and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft),\\n>> and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.\\n\\nThis is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmitter\\nvaries from unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmission\\nline, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unit\\nover time. You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. With\\nthe radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at\\none place, it is much easier to do.

There are non-surgical ways,\\nhowever, to keep the ostia open (however, in a few individuals, their\\nostia are naturally very small), and Dr. Ivker\\'s book talks about this.\\nThe underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of\\nsinus surgery, though.\\n\\nAbout asthma, that\\'s a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker, in his book,\\n\"Sinus Survival\", *speculates* (and says it\\'s not proven), that many cases\\nof asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage\\n(postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  He\\'s had many patients who\\'ve found\\nrelief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated -\\nnot clinical proof, but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation.\\n\\nBefore doing any sinus surgery, first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery,\\nas well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis.\\n\\nJon Noring\\n\\n-- \\n\\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\\n\\nIf you\\'re dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I\\'ll send info.\\n=============================================================================\\n| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          |\\n| JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED\\'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE |\\n| 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World\\'s Best!    |\\n| Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |\\n=============================================================================\\nWho are you?

Gorden \\nRubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize \\nthe chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use \\nand they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to \\nrestore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is \\nyet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care \\npatients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just \\nbecause he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that \\nall physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be \\nfound in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.

The arguement is that without proof, no action is \\nwarrented.\\n\\nMedicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There \\nhas always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is \\nkidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been \\ndone to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the \\nintake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones \\nfrom forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to \\nbreakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of \\nMedicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, \\nincreasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is \\nrestricting calcium intake.\\n\\nThe conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to \\nbe reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.\\nIf it makes sense for livestock, why doesn\\'t it make sense for humans \\nDavid?

Results of their research\\nwill be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal,\\nRadiology.\\n   Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\\ncalled magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led\\nby Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly\\npatients who were believed to be suffering from some form of\\ndementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special\\nsoftware developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical\\nProton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses\\nin less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton\\nMRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination\\ntime yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10\\nminutes.  By comparison, the current \"standard of care\" in testing\\nfor Alzheimer\\'s disease calls for lengthy memory function and\\nneuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the\\npatient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.\\n   In addition to Alzheimer\\'s disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS\\nexam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including\\nAIDS-related dementia, Parkinson\\'s disease and Huntington\\'s\\ndisease.\\n   \"We\\'ve developed a simple test which can be administered quickly\\nand relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted\\nwith either the MRS or PROBE software,\" said Dr. Ross, adding,\\n\"this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer\\'s earlier and\\nintervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease\\ncauses further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.\"\\n   Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the\\nbrain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker\\nin the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed\\nwith Alzheimer\\'s showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their\\nlevel of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was\\nsignificantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons\\nbelieved to be associated with the progression of the disease.\\n   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer\\'s disease is widely\\nconsidered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross\\nbelieves, to the theory that Alzheimer\\'s is caused by an\\ninterruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to\\nthe nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15\\nyears, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer\\'s were based\\non the changing receptors for acetylcholine.\\n   \"Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate\\nAlzheimer\\'s from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or\\nher family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment\\nprotocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we\\nconsider this test a major advancement in medicine,\" said Bruce\\nMiller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher\\nand a co-author of the study.\\n   Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats,\\nPh.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley,\\nR.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200\\nGeneral Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States,\\nand will be configured for other manufacturers\\' MRI units soon.\\n   For interviews with Dr. Ross, advance copies of the Radiology\\nMay issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart or\\nBelinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877.\\n\\n   Q & A on Alzheimer\\'s Disease:\\n\\n   What is Alzheimer\\'s disease and how is it caused?\\n   Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of\\nthe brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist\\nAlois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of\\nmemory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality,\\nloss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.\\n   How many people does it affect?\\n   Alzheimer\\'s disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in\\nthe United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking\\napproximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer\\'s\\ndebilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both\\nemotionally and financially, for patients\\' families.  AD is the\\nmost common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every\\nyear, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.\\n   What are its signs and symptoms?\\n   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have\\nbeen identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk\\nof developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50\\nyars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life\\nto reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial\\nAD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of\\ndeveloping AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe \"forgetfulness\"\\ncaused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School\\nof Medicine at New York University says \"whether forgetfulness is\\na serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree\" and\\nsuggests the following criteria:\\n\\n   -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is\\n      normal.\\n   -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.\\n   -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.\\n   -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.\\n\\n   Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be\\nevaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer\\'s disease and other forms\\nof dementia.\\n -30-\\n--\\nCanada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario\\n416-629-7000/629-7044\\n',\n",

As I understand it,\\nthe hernia is a relatively minor problem, though I do occasionally\\nhave some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzki\\nring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular,\\nif I\\'m not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food,\\nfood occasionally gets \"stuck\" before reaching my stomach. This results\\nin a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction.\\nFortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying,\\nand causes frequent discomfort.\\n\\nMy doctor wants to \"dilate\" the ring using the\\nfollowing procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach\\nfor any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing\\nsome kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to know\\nif anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so,\\nwas it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone  comment on\\nsafety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? Has it become\\na common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding\\nprocedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this,\\nespecially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforation,\\nreaction to anesthesia).\\n\\nThe second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large number\\nof \"extra\" heartbeats. In particular, during the past month or so there\\nhas been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC\\'s in 24\\nhrs, along with a few PAC\\'s. (Many days, there are far more than this,\\nhowever-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated, and the cardiologist\\nindicated that such a number was \"normal\". It certainly doesn\\'t\\nfeel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of\\nextended \"runs\" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to cause\\nsevere light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in good\\nhealth (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs or\\ncaffeine, etc. I\\'m willing to accept the extra beats as \"normal\", but don\\'t\\nwant to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The number\\nof PVC\\'s seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or something\\nas simple as climbing some stairs). Also, if I get up after sitting or lying\\ndown for a while, I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possibly\\nbe related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about the\\nsame time.\\n\\nThanks for any help/advice!\\n\\n\\n===============================================================================\\n===============================================================================\\n',\n",

Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized \"jargon\",\\nnecessary for precise communication within their field (which I\\'m fully\\ncognizant of since I, too, speak \"jargonese\" when with my peers).  For the\\nsituation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can\\nhave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the\\nworld at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word,\\nand very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of \"systemic\".\\nIt is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much\\nmore so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of\\nthis newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially\\nequal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan\\nthe flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get\\nreally \"beat up\" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they\\notherwise don\\'t see much of in their practice except for the occasional\\n\"difficult\" patient.\\n\\nPoint 2:\\n\\nI understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not\\nprescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments\\nhave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed\\nclinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are\\npart of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any\\ndifferently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it\\nfollows that any therapy not on the \"accepted\" list is therefore a non-\\ntherapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or\\ntheory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation\\nof what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from\\na treatment point-of-view.\\n\\nAnd by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/\\nscience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as\\nalso being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people\\nthat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where\\n\"standard\" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and\\nwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid \"scientific\" viewpoint is in\\nitself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying\\nintent of the \"scientific\" approach to medicine is to protect the health of\\nthe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the\\npatient should come first when considering treatment.\\n\\nWhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both\\nthe \"scientific\" and the \"humanitarian\" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I\\noutlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any\\nphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe\\nalternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)\\nfor patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted\\n(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such\\ntherapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that\\nthere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived\\nfrom them.\\n\\nThis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies\\nthe humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients\\nwho have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted\\nmedicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the\\ndoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing\\ntheir license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical\\ntraining.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control\\nmore within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned\\ncould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most\\nproductive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I\\'m\\nsure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented\\nmore as a strawman to stimulate discussion.\\n\\nHopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to\\nwhy I am \"open\" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real\\ndifficulty (read \"apparent hostility\") with the \"coldness\" of the 99.9% pure\\n\"scientific\" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical\\ntreatment is one where both the \"humanitarian\" aspects are balanced with and\\nby the \"scientific\" aspects.

For example, why does the earth\\'s\\natmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive\\nanswer is \"photosynthesis\", but this is clearly incomplete.

What is needed\\nis photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of\\nthe resulting reduced material.\\n\\nOn earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic\\nmatter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires\\ncontinental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow\\nthat most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).\\n\\nThis suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without\\ncontinents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating\\nan oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a\\nhard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.\\n\\nThere is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth\\'s atmosphere\\nhas been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least\\n2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to\\nweathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback\\nmechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak\\nanthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen\\nlevel had dropped too low, we wouldn\\'t be here to be wondering about\\nit.\\n\\n\\tPaul F.

But, so the reasoning continues, this energy \\n      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes\\n      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.\\n      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must\\n      be wrong.\"\\nAs so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who\\nwas trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It\\nmay be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray\\nburst, but the \\'fireball\\' of energy and matter that is created\\nmay spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding \\nmedium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may\\ncarry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All\\nthis is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,\\nPeter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.\\nIt is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one\\naround (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative\\nproposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the \\nso-called \\'failed supernovae\\' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which\\na very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black\\nhole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter\\nwill be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal\\nforce, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the\\nblack hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,\\nwhich again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such\\nevents may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,\\nbut the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate\\nof bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two\\nscenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less\\nin the failed supernova scenario.\\n\\nOn another note: I do believe that the distance scale must \\nultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method\\nsuch as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,\\nor finding a definitive signature of some known class of\\nobjects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists\\nhave historically not been too successfull in finding the\\ndistance of any object by proving that there is only one\\npossible way in which the object can work, and therefore\\nit *must* be so-and-so.\\n\\nRalph Wijers\\n\\n',\n",

Larson, 1984, North \\n          Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed, \\n          hardcover. \\n          \\n\\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to \\n          most ALL astrophysical mysteries. \\n          \\n               This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged \\n          edition of \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\", 1959.  \\n          Volume I is \"NOTHING BUT MOTION\" (1979), and Volume II is \\n          \"THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\" (1988). \\n          \\n               Most books and journal articles on the subject of \\n          astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial \\n          differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by \\n          contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except \\n          for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.  \\n          Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical \\n          agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual \\n          validity. \\n          \\n               Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor \\n          of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State \\n          University.  He developed the Theory described in his books \\n          while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the \\n          properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements \\n          they contain. \\n          \\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" describes the astrophysical \\n          portions of Larson\\'s CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE, \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of \\n          \"grand unified field theory\" that orthodox physicists and \\n          astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of \\n          space and time: \\n          \\n               (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME. \\n          \\n               (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN. \\n          \\n               From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a \\n          COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic \\n          particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the \\n          concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-\\n          vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was \\n          able to match parts of his theoretical universe with \\n          corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including \\n          EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959 \\n          book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES, \\n          several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They \\n          are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And \\n          when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation \\n          ready for those also. \\n          \\n               As a result of his theory, which he called \"THE \\n          RECIPROCAL SYSTEM\", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the \\n          sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists, \\n          including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, \\n          quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure), \\n          \"nuclear\" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass \\n          increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in \\n          stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be \\n          nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very \\n          critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles, \\n          solutions in principle, \"no other way\" declarations, etc., \\n          used to maintain them. \\n          \\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" is divided into 31 chapters.  \\n          It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from \\n          the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, \\n          which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that \\n          accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in \\n          from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy \\n          formation from the MYTHICAL \"big bang\" is a big mystery to \\n          orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life \\n          cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and \\n          solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of \\n          SINGLE stars. \\n          \\n               Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according \\n          to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have \\n          been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies \\n          and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT \\n          (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME). \\n          \\n               Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against \\n          observations that contradict their theories would find \\n          Larson\\'s explanations quite valuable if considered with an \\n          OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY \\n          BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the \\n          plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray \\n          telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from \\n          ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any \\n          visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional \\n          coincidence).  Larson\\'s explanation is that the gamma ray \\n          bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER \\n          HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the \"cosmic \\n          sector\".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a \\n          RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed \\n          of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE \\n          dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the \\n          bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly \\n          at random. \\n          \\n               Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from \\n          books, journal articles, and leading physicists and \\n          astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted \\n          with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the \\n          end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book \\n          \"Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey\", by William K. Hartmann, \\n          says, \"Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if \\n          we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars \\n          form.... Unfortunately we cannot.\"  Larson\\'s book contains \\n          LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are \\n          WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists, \\n          astronomers, and astrophysicists. \\n\\n\\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \\n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (Larson\\'s BOOKS). \\n\\n\\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \\n          IMPORTANT Book Review is ENCOURAGED. \\n\\n          \\n                                   Robert E.

Furthermore, it is\\nlikely to raise serious practical problems.  What if the child is from\\na baptist tradition?  Normally when he reaches the age of decision, he\\nwould be expected to make a decision and be baptized.  But he already\\nhas been, by a church claiming to be a Baptist church.  So does he get\\nrebaptized?  Neither answer is really very good.  If not, he's being\\nrobbed of an experience that should be very significant to his faith.\\n\\n--clh]\\n\",\n",

       " 'From: hedrick@geneva.rutgers.edu\\nSubject: FAQ essay on homosexuality\\nLines: 452\\n\\nSomeone referred to my FAQ essay on homosexuality.  Since it hasn\\'t\\nbeen posted for some time (and I\\'ve modified it somewhat since the\\nlast time), I\\'m taking this opportunity to post it.  There is another\\nentry in the FAQ containing comments by some other contributors.  They\\ncan be retrieved from ftp.rutgers.edu as\\npub/soc.religion.christian/others/homosexuality.  It contains far\\nmore detail on the exegetical issues than I give here, though\\nprimarily from a conservative point of view.\\n\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThis posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and\\nChristians.  This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post the\\nquestion each time it occurs.  Rather this is an attempt to summarize\\nthe postings we get when we have a discussion.  It summarizes\\narguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most people\\nasking the question already know the arguments against it.  The most\\ncommon -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is \"how can a\\nChristian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says about\\nit?\"\\n\\nFirst, on the definition of \\'homosexual\\'.  Many groups believe that\\nthere is a homosexual \"orientation\", i.e. a sexual attraction to\\nmembers of the same sex.  This is distinguished from actual homosexual\\nsexual activity.  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by\\nmost groups to be acceptable.  However in a lot of discussion, the\\nterm \\'homosexual\\' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex.\\nThis is generally not accepted outside the most \\'liberal\\' groups.  In\\nthis paper I\\'m going to use \\'homosexual\\' as meaning a person engaging\\nin sexual acts with another of the same sex.  I haven\\'t heard of any\\nBiblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who\\nremains celebate.\\n\\nI think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be\\nhomosexual.  This is often called a \\'homosexual orientation\\'.  It is\\nnot known whether it is genetic or environmental.  There is evidence\\nsuggesting each.  The best evidence I\\'ve seen is that homosexuality is\\nnot a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes.  One of\\nthem is probably genetic.  There are several groups that try to help\\npeople move from being homosexual to heterosexual.  The best-known is\\nExodus International\".  The reports I\\'ve seen (and I haven\\'t read the\\ndetailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the\\nPresbyterian Church\\'s infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that\\nthese programs have very low success rates, and that there are\\nquestions about how real even the successes are.  But there certainly\\nare people who say they have converted.  However this issue is not as\\nimportant as it sounds.  Those who believe homosexuality is wrong\\nbelieve it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.  The fact\\nthat it\\'s hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant\\nthan the fact that it\\'s hard to escape from being a drug addict.  If\\nit\\'s wrong, it\\'s wrong.  It may affect how we deal with people though.\\nIf it\\'s very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more\\nwilling to forgive it.\\n\\nOne more general background issue: It\\'s common to quote a figure that\\n10% of the population is homosexual.  I asked one of our experts where\\nthis came from.  Here\\'s his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source\\nof the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by\\norientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely\\nheterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).  According to Kinsey,\\none-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of\\norgasm homosexually post puberty.  Ten percent of all adult males have\\nmost of their experiences of homosexually.  That was in 1948.  The\\npercentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey\\nInstitute, based on data in the early seventies but not published\\nuntil the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe.  I can\\'t\\nput my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online\\ninformation for Kinsey\\'s own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalog\\nat Rutgers:\\n   AUTHOR Kinsey, Alfred Charles, 1894-1956.\\n    TITLE Sexual behavior in the human male [by] Alfred C.

A\\njournalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting\\nher book that allegedly refutes Kinsey\\'s study, but the scholarly\\nworld seems to take her for a kook......\\n\\nI\\'ve seen some objections to the Kinsey\\'s study, but not in enough\\ndetail to include here.  (If someone would like to contribute another\\nview, I\\'d be willing to include it.)\\n\\nMost Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong.\\nNot all, however.  A few denominations accept it.  The Metropolitan\\nCommunity Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to\\naccept homosexuals.  However the United Church of Christ also allows\\nit, and I think a couple of other groups may as well.  The Episcopal\\nChurch seems to accept it some areas but not others.  In churches that\\nhave congregational government, you\\'ll find a few congregations that\\naccept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probably\\nonly one or two congregations).  But these are unusual -- few churches\\npermit homosexual church leaders.  How carefully they enforce this is\\nanother issue.  I don\\'t have any doubt that there are homosexual\\npastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others.\\n\\nAs to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, here\\'s an\\nattempt to summarize the issues:\\n\\nThe most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of\\nhomosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell:\\n\"Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality\", U Chicago Press,\\n1980.\\n\\nThe argument against is pretty clear.  There are several explicit laws\\nin the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on\\nhomosexuality.  Beyond these references, there are some debates.  Some\\npassages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.  E.g.\\nthe sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was\\nhomosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults.\\n(There\\'s even some question whether it was homosexual, since the\\nentities involved were angels.)  It was particularly horrifying\\nbecause it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in\\nthat culture was very strong.  (This is probably the reason Lot\\noffered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to\\nallow his guests to be attacked.)  If you look through a concordance\\nfor references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, you\\'ll see that few\\nseem to imply that homosexuality was their sin.  There\\'s a Jewish\\ninterpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.  At any\\nrate, there\\'s no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong.\\n\\nI do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set\\nof laws that most Christians do not consider binding.  So unless NT\\njustification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue.\\n\\nThe NT references are all in Paul\\'s letters.  A number of the\\nreferences from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly\\nvague.  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not\\nmean homosexual.  Here\\'s what he says: The two Greek words that appear\\nin the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and\\n/arsenokoitai/.  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words\\nactually mean.  /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety\\nof metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.  Boswell suggests\\n\"wanton\" as a likely equivalent.  He also reports that the unanimous\\ninterpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, was\\nthat in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has\\nvanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be less\\nfrowned-upon.  (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the\\nCatholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.)  He\\ntranslates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none\\nof the church fathers understood the term as referring to\\nhomosexuality in general.  A more technical meaning, suggested by the\\nearly Latin translations, would be \"active mode homosexual male\\nprostitute\", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically.\\n\\nFor a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fee\\'s commentary on I\\nCor.  He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate.\\nHowever Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not\\nnecessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated\\nwith some kinds of homosexual behavior.  Given what Boswell and Fee\\nsay taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not very\\ndefinite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it\\nisn\\'t a general term for homosexuality.  While Fee argues against\\nBoswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a\\ntranslation that seems essentially the same.  The big problem with it\\nis that the word is almost never used.  Paul\\'s writing is the first\\noccurence.  The fact that the word is clearly composed of \"male\" and\\n\"f**k\" unfortunately doesn\\'t quite tell us the meaning, since it\\ndoesn\\'t tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the\\naction.  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given.\\nIn theory it could refer to rapists, etc.  It\\'s dangerous to base\\nmeaning purely on etymology, or you\\'ll conclude that \"goodbye\" is a\\nreligious expression because it\\'s based on \"God by with ye\".  However\\nsince Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on \"homosexual male\\nprostitute\", that seems as good a guess as any.  Note that this\\ntranslation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something\\nwhich Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in\\ntheir translation).\\n\\nIn my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans\\n1.  Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something\\nthat happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result\\nof their corruption due to worshipping false gods.  One could argue\\nthat this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false\\ngods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become\\nheterosexual.  However I find this argument somewhat forced, and in\\nfact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is\\nwhat Paul meant.\\n\\nHowever I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law\\nagainst homosexuality for Christians.  What Paul is describing in Rom\\n1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it\\'s homosexuality that\\nappeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness.\\nDespite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, I\\'m sure Paul\\ndoes not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex.\\nGiven his description of their situation, I rather assume that their\\nheterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless.  So yes, I do\\nbelieve that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality.\\nBut in all fairness, the \"shameless\" nature of their acts is a\\nreflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a\\nspecific feature of homosexuality.\\n\\nMy overall view of the situation is the following: I think we have\\nenough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of\\nhomosexuality.  Rom 1 seems clear.  While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are\\nnot unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do\\nnot seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of\\nhomosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the\\nother hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the\\nsubject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality\\nin passing.\\n\\nThe result of this situation is that people interpret these passages\\nin light of their general approach to Scripture.  For those who look\\nto Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising\\nthat they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT\\nprohibition.  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal,\\nit is not surprising that they regard Paul\\'s negative view of\\nhomosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing\\nwithout any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel.  As\\nreaders of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these\\napproaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the\\nmouth when they see the opposing view described.  There\\'s not a lot I\\ncan do as moderator about such a situation.\\n\\nA number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of\\ndetailed exegesis of texts that is described above.  However in fact\\nI\\'m not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their\\nown beliefs on such analyses.  The real issue seems to rest on the\\nquestion of whether Paul\\'s judgement should apply to modern\\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nOne commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds\\nof questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality\\nonly in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was\\nwrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act\\n\"straight\" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying\\nto define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian\\nideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the\\nrelationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul\\'s\\njudgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make\\njudgements on these questions.\\n\\nAnother is the following: In Paul\\'s time homosexuality was associated\\nwith a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable.  It\\nwas part of temple prostitution.  Among private citizens, it often\\noccured between adults and children or free people and slaves.  I\\'m\\nnot in a position to say that it always did, but there are some\\nreasons to think so.  The ancients distinguished between the active\\nand passive partner.  It was considered disgraceful for a free adult\\nto act as the passive partner.  (This is the reason that an active\\nmode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.  His\\ncustomers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)  This\\nsupports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two\\nfree adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal.\\nClearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children,\\nslaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible\\npartners.  (However Fee\\'s commentary on I Cor cites some examples from\\nancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve\\nfree adults in a reasonably symmetrical way.  Thus the considerations\\nin this paragraph shouldn\\'t be pushed too far.  Homosexuality may have\\nbeen discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but there\\nsurely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not\\ninvolve slaves or children.)\\n\\nSome people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against\\nhomosexuality.  I\\'d like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by\\npromiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Someone who has a\\nhomosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is\\nnot at risk for AIDS.\\n\\nNote that there is good reason from Paul\\'s general approach to doubt\\nthat he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative,\\napart from any specific statements on homosexuality.  I believe his\\nuse of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual\\nmarriage as what God ordained.\\n\\nHowever the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning\\nagainst being too quick to deal with this issue legally.\\n\\nI claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is\\nnot entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul\\'s\\ntendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating\\nholidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues\\nto look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to\\navoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.\\nFor example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat\\nmeat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about\\nwhich they had personal qualms.  For another example, Paul obviously\\nwould have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)\\nremain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly\\nwould rather see them married than in a state where they might be\\ntempted to fornication.\\n\\nI believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the\\nviews Paul expressed in Rom 1.  One may believe that homosexuality is\\nnot what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still\\nconclude that at times we have to live with it.  Note that in the\\ncreation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This\\ndoesn\\'t mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  The\\nquestion is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful\\nor whether you believe that it\\'s a misfortune that is in a broad sense\\ndue to human sinfulness.  If you\\'re willing to consider the latter\\napproach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more\\ndamage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it.\\nThe dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often\\nfails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from\\npsychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when\\nattempts at living as a heterosexual fail.\\n\\nThis is going to depend upon one\\'s assessment of the inherent nature\\nof homosexuality.  If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you\\nmay be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it.\\nClearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency\\nto steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these\\nconditions are also very difficult.  However these conditions are\\nintrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for\\nhomosexuality.  (Many problems associated with homosexuality are\\nactually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality.  This includes\\nAIDS.  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual\\nrelationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent\\nto Christian heterosexual relationships.)\\n\\nIn the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we\\'ve\\nheard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in\\nthis situation.  I\\'ve also seen summaries of various research and the\\nresults of various efforts for \"conversion\".  (Aside from the\\nPresbyterian report mentioned above, there\\'s an FAQ that summarizes\\nour readers\\' reports on this question.)  The evidence is that\\nlong-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a\\npar with healing miracles.  The danger in advising Christians to\\ndepend upon such a change is clear: When \"conversion\" doesn\\'t happen,\\nwhich is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling\\nexcluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement\\nof life-long celibacy.  Paul recognized (though in a different\\ncontext) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and I\\nthink the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that\\njudgement.  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay\\nsex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality.  Maybe\\nhomosexuality isn\\'t God\\'s original ideal, but I can well imagine Paul\\npreferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian\\nrelationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis\\nsuggests wasn\\'t part of God\\'s original ideal either -- I think such\\nrelationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God\\'s love\\nwith each other.\\n\\nThere\\'s an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this\\ndiscussion.  The issue is that of \"cultural relativism\".  That is,\\nwhen Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an\\neternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations\\nin the culture of the time?  Conservative Christians generally insist\\non taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomes\\nsubjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as\\nrelative?\\n\\nWhen looking at this issue, it\\'s worth noting that no one completely\\nrejects the concept of cultural relativism.  There are a number of\\njudgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians\\nconsider to be relative.  The following judgements are at least as\\nclear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality:\\n\\n  - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in\\n\\tthe OT -- it\\'s not in the NT, but I mention it here because\\n\\tuntil relatively recently the Church did consider it binding\\n\\ton Christians)\\n  - prohibition against swearing oaths\\n  - endorsement of slavery as an institution\\n  - judgement of tax collectors as sinner\\n\\nWe do not regard these items as binding.  In most cases, I believe the\\nargument is essentially one of cultural relativism.  Briefly:\\n\\n  - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific\\n\\tagrarian society that the Bible was trying to build,\\n\\tbut not to our market economy.\\n  - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the\\n\\tsame characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was\\n\\tconcerned about\\n  - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people\\n\\thow to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as\\n\\tan institution\\n  - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to\\n\\tRoman tax farming\\n\\nThe point I\\'m trying to make is that before applying Biblical\\nprohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20th\\nCent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their\\nrelationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul\\nwould have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of\\nargument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.\\nUntil fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, and\\nmany Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed.  (Indeed,\\nslavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship\\nbetween God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants\\nor slaves of God.)\\n\\nI am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally\\nrelative.  Rather, I\\'m trying to say that *some* things are, and\\ntherefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in\\nthe Bible, that ends the discussion.  We need to look at whether the\\naction we\\'re talking about now has the same moral implications as the\\none that the Bible was talking about.  If Christians want to argue\\nthat there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against\\nhomosexuality are still binding, I\\'m willing to listen.  Those who\\nclaim that the question doesn\\'t need to be looked at are kidding\\nthemselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey\\nall the rules listed above).\\n\\nOne thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue\\ncreates.  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence --\\nsome laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter is\\nreally idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose\\nwords are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among\\nChristians seems rather out of proportion.  This should suggest to\\npeople that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved.\\nThis is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as\\nstrongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments\\nas conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments.  But I\\ncan\\'t help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way\\nof justifying attitudes which come from other sources.  This is a\\ndangerous situation for Christians.\\n\\nOn the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems I\\nhave with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented.\\nOne of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically\\ndetermined.  I.e. \"God made me homosexual\", and I have no choice.  I\\nthink \"God made me homosexual\" is a fine view for people who already\\nbelieve on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable.  But I\\ndon\\'t see it as an argument for acceptability.\\n\\nMany people think that alcholism is largely biological, and drug\\naddiction may turn out to be as well.  That doesn\\'t mean it\\'s OK.\\nMost of us have particular things we tend to do wrong.  Some people\\nget angry easily.  Others tend to be arrogant.  Others tend to be\\nattraced to women who are married to someone else.  Homosexuality (if\\nwe view it as wrong) wouldn\\'t be different than any of these other\\nthings.  If we are going to follow God, we all end up at one time or\\nanother having to work to overcome bad habits and particular\\ntemptations that cause us problems.  None of us can sit back and say\\nthat because God made us the way we are we can just relax.  As Jesus\\nsaid, we all have to take up our cross daily.  This concept of dying\\nto self (which also appears throughout Paul\\'s letters) seems to\\nsuggest that there are going to be things about ourselves that we we\\nare called on not to accept.  Paul\\'s letters and the experience of\\nChristians throughout history show us that sin is ingrained in us, and\\nthe battle against it is lifelong and difficult.  The fact that\\nhomosexuality is difficult to fight doesn\\'t necessarily say it\\'s OK.\\nMaybe this isn\\'t the place where we have to die to self.  But I\\'d like\\nto make sure that those who think it isn\\'t are fighting the battle\\nsomewhere else, and not rejecting the concept that all Christians have\\nto fight against the deeply engrained habits of sin.\\n',\n",

These people -- and those associated with them\\n    (\"Now there were with us seven brethren\", Matt. 22:25) -- would not\\n    be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage.  Hence,\\n    the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni-\\n    ties; but that doesn\\'t mean other, more faithful people could not\\n    have this blessing.\\n\\n(2) Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of\\n    =being= married, and the process of =becoming= married.  The latter\\n    activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in\\n    the eternities, because all eternal marriages will be taken care of\\n    before then.\\n\\n(3) The account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic Gospels) is\\n    missing something that would make its real meaning clearer.  Note\\n    that we (LDS) do not believe in Biblical inerrancy, so we do not in\\n    general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with\\n    modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter-day proph-\\n    ets.  Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question\\n    was not significantly revised in the \"Joseph Smith Translation\" or\\n    \"Inspired Version\" of the Bible, since we do not believe this work\\n    was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con-\\n    stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the KJV.\\n\\n-- \\nRich Wales <richw@mks.com>       //      Mortice Kern Systems Inc.

I\\'ve never quite understood\\nthe trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But,\\nat the same time, he is God\\'s son \"For God so loved the world that he gave his\\nonly begotten son\". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could\\nhe really be God\\'s son? If the Holy Ghost \"planted the seed\" in Mary, so to speak,\\nthen it seems that Jesus\\' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the\\nhuman father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father\\'s \\nqualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try\\nand say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that\\ncase, Jesus and God aren\\'t the same. On the other hand, if their relationship\\nisn\\'t the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God\\nincarnate, then he\\'s not really God\\'s son and he never was. He\\'s just God\\nmanifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I\\'m seeing it. Can someone\\nwho is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? \\n\\nGetting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid\\nto redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would\\nrise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing\\nhow this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body\\nmay have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical\\npain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.\\nThe fact that Jesus was God\\'s only begotten son doesn\\'t seem to me to have much\\nmeaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only\\none was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very\\noffensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my\\nsincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ.\\nBut, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.\\n \\n[Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together.\\nFirst, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this\\ngroup, it\\'s dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You\\nseem to be suggesting the Jesus is God\\'s son in a physical sense,\\nwith the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that\\nterrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin\\nBirth says that Jesus\\' birth is God\\'s responsibility.  But it doesn\\'t\\nimply that God\\'s sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no means\\nthe only) speculation is that God used Joseph\\'s genetic material.\\n\\nSecond, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In a\\nTrinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is\\na part of God.  The Son didn\\'t come into existence with Jesus\\' birth.\\nJesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn\\'t\\nspecifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it\\'s the Son\\nwho was incarnated.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

I\\'m not sure if\\nthey should have stormed the compound or not.  By the way, Jehova Witnesses\\nare a religious minority in this country.  Protestantism is a minority\\nreligion in the World.  BDs were a cult by all definitions and history of\\ncults.  To say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave.\\nKoresh said he was the Messiah.  I was raised a Baptist, although I do\\nnot practice the religion and do not think that the Big Guy upstairs is\\ndigging the divisiveness, closemindedness, and right-wing morons that are\\nassociated with the religion.  Anyway, the Messiah that I was taught about\\nwould not be carrying a gun, let alone stockpiling weapons.  You can doubt\\nBATF reports all you want, David Koresh was not a poor soul who was\\nunjustly persecuted.  While some of the information coming from the U.S\\ngovernment is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side, I\\ndo believe that some of the things that former cult members have said\\nare true.  Anyway, this is just another excuse to try and blame President\\nClinton for something.  People who attempt to do this for political motives\\nshould be ashamed.  THEY are the ones who are keeping this country from\\nreaching its full potential.\\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

All rights reserved. \\n\\nBy NICK LUDINGTON \\n Associated Press Writer \\n   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After the Persian Gulf War ended, the world was\\ntold that \\nas many as 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed. At one point, even Baghdad put \\nthe toll that high, as did the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency in private. \\n   But U.S. officials have been backpedaling ever since, even though the \\nPentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public. \\nNow, one former DIA analyst says the number of Iraqi troops killed may\\nhave been \\nas low as 1,500. \\n   That conclusion by John Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the \\nquarterly magazine Foreign Policy, represents the lowest estimate yet\\nfrom U.S. \\ndefense sources. \\n   The revisions suggesting a less devastating Iraqi toll fit a pattern of \\nvastly moderated U.S. military claims in the months after the war ended.\\nClaims \\nfor a number of U.S. weapons also were scaled down. \\n   Despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking \\npictures of Iraq\\'s disastrous retreat from Kuwait, arguments have continued \\nunabated about what really happened in the Gulf War. \\n   Heidenrich is not the first to question the Iraqi death toll numbers that \\noriginally were aired. More that a year ago, Air Force Lt. Gen. Charles\\nHorner, \\nthe commander of the air campaign in the Gulf War, said he believed the Iraqi \\nmilitary death toll was fewer than 10,000 for the entire war. \\n   The Pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of \\nIraqis who died in the 42-day war against the U.S.-led coalition in\\nJanuary and \\nFebruary 1991. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Joe Gradisher\\nreiterated \\npast statements that \"there just isn\\'t a number,\" that is credible. \\n   But some current internal estimates range from 8,000 to 25,000 Iraqi troops \\nkilled, said one analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, who is familiar \\nwith the Pentagon\\'s reports. \\n   Allied deaths were put at 146 Americans, 35 by friendly fire; 24 British, 9 \\nby American fire; 2 Frenchmen, 1 Italian and 39 among various Arab allies. \\n   Of the postwar reassessments, the most widely publicized was the Army\\'s \\nreluctant acknowledgement, months later, that its touted Patriot air defense \\nsystem was nowhere near so effective as claimed against Iraq\\'s Scud missiles. \\nThe Bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the \\nPatriot; last spring it revised the hit ratio to 60 percent. \\n   The success record of the Navy\\'s Tomahawk high-tech cruise missile used \\nagainst targets in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq also turned out to be more \\nmodest than initially indicated by the Pentagon. \\n   The first Iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a\\nMay 1991 \\nreport by the environmental group Greenpeace, which said 100,000 to 120,000 \\nIraqi soldiers were killed. It estimated that 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians \\nwere also killed. \\n   The same month, published reports said the Defense Intelligence Agency \\nestimated 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded in the\\nair and \\nground campaigns -- although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate \\ncould be off by as much as 50 percent in either direction. \\n   But as more information became available, those figures gradually were \\nrevised downward. \\n   The House Armed Services Committee staff estimated 9,000 dead and 17,000 \\nwounded after a review last year. \\n   But Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the quarterly Foreign\\nPolicy, \\nestimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives\\nas low as \\n1,500 -- with about 3,000 wounded. \\n   Heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of\\nbodies found \\nand buried by U.S. troops -- 577 -- and on prisoner of war interviews.\\nHe noted \\nthat only about 2,000 of 69,000 Iraqi prisoners of war were wounded. \\n   Based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were \\ncaptured, he put the number of wounded at about 3,000. Using a conservative \\nratio of one dead to two wounded, applicable to Third World armies like\\nIraq, he \\nset battlefield deaths at 1,500. \\n   \"Maybe the figures are too low,\" he wrote. \"Maybe the real death toll\\non the \\nbattlefield was 2,000 or 3,000 or even 6,000. Even then, the evidence\\nsuggests a \\ndeath toll of well below 100,000 -- or even 10,000.\" \\n   In an interview, he said the 100,000 figure was obviously off base\\nbecause it \\nwould mean that virtually all the Iraqi soldiers in the Kuwait theater of \\noperations were casualties. \\n   He said today\\'s bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology, \\nbut rather the drawn-out conflicts such as those in Yugoslavia and Somalia. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n',\n",

Azeri views on this dispute have\\n[AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me\\n[AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the\\n[AR] origins of the conflict.\\n\\nDuring the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject,\\na small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri.\\n\\nThe following should be interesting. \\n\\n[AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and\\n[AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually,\\n[AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian\\n[AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988,\\n[AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move,\\n[AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait\\n[AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990.\\n\\nThis not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an\\nindependent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September\\n1991, page 28, we read:\\n\\n \"By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in\\n  Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party\\n  for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to\\n  reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were\\n  deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000 \\n  Armenian inhabitants fled the city...\"\\n\\n  Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in\\n  Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away.\"\\n\\nIn this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian \\npogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988!\\n\\n[AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that\\n[AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule\\n[AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of \"divide and\\n[AR] rule.\"  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year\\n[AR] history of the conflict.\\n\\nIt is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the\\nperpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions.\\n \\n[AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in\\n[AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an\\n[AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in\\n[AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian\\n[AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran.\\n\\nIncorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an\\nagreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno-\\nKarabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.\\n \\n[AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri\\n[AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and\\n[AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the\\n[AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly\\n[AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly\\n[AR] nationalistic National Independence Party.\\n \\nIt\\'s called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn\\'t try to deport and allow the \\nArmenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian\\nculture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The\\nAzeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and\\nplay dead. \\n\\n[AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country\\n[AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the\\n[AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish\\n[AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government\\n[AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and\\n[AR] possessions?\\n\\nThe Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they\\nattempted to deprive Armenians of \"lands, homes, and possessions\".\\n \\n[AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.\\n[AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian\\n[AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible,\\n[AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus.\\n\\nTrue, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach!\\n \\n[AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.\\n[AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western\\n[AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security\\n[AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led\\n[AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed\\n[AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the\\n[AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct.\\n[AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces.\\n\\nWestern interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into\\nthis conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of \\nEurope (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia!\\nDr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would\\nhave us believe.\\n \\n[AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an\\n[AR]\"Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan.\"  The truth is that the Armenians\\n[AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.\\n\\nIncorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish\\nclaim. \\n\\nArmenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as \"Artsakh\", which \\ncomes from the Urartian term \"Urtekhe-Urtekhini\". NO Azeris yet! \\n\\nAncient Greeks referred to Artsakh as \"Orkhistena\". NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nIn the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid\\nArmenia of Media. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nFrom the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom\\nof Ervan. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nArtsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or \\nArtsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nAfter Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 \\nA.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nEnd of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the \\nAranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nBy the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nEmperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen \"To\\nArmenia\". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nIn the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area\\nwas stated as 11,000.\\n\\nIt was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central\\nAsia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence\\nin the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!\\n\\nIn 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some \\nMuslims in Karabakh!\\n\\nIn 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188\\npriests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian\\npercentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh --\\nassuming no Kurds!\\n\\nConsider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920:\\n\\n \"The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the\\n  proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings\\n  to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between\\n  Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and\\n  Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis\\n  Republic.\\n\\n  Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet\\n  Armenia and Azerbaidzan!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tN.

The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule\\nin the Caucasus, including Karabakh!\\n\\n[AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew\\n[AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris.  How\\n[AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in\\n[AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and\\n[AR] demanded separation from California?\\n\\nNon-sequitur. \\n \\n[AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement\\n[AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians.  That is correct.\\n\\nArmenian historians don\\'t say this!\\n\\n[AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the\\n[AR] fourth century.  But those ancient residents had no link to and\\n[AR] nothing in common with Armenians.\\n\\nConsidering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, and\\ntheir utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an \\nargument totally invalid!\\n\\n[AR] Azeris would have a better claim to\\n[AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited,\\n[AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation.\\n\\nWishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo-\\npolitical advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity,\\nAzeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their\\nminorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other\\nnationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan.\\n\\n[AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the\\n[AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the\\n[AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual\\n[AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  This\\n[AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the\\n[AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory\\n[AR] nations, not just by Turkey.\\n\\nSuch agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of\\nArmenians.\\n \\n[AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the\\n[AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran.  The second key to untying the\\n[AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the\\n[AR] U.N. definition of 1974.\\n\\nFine, so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian\\nenclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territory\\nis the home of Armenians, the UN, would by definition, support the local\\npopulation! \\n \\n[AR] When that is accomplished, the international community can and should\\n[AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as\\n[AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the\\n[AR] former Yugoslavia.  Such decisive collective international action can\\n[AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh, and prevent the Armenian-Azeri\\n[AR] conflict from growing and spreading.\\n \\nAzerbaijan\\'s refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their\\nown future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are \\nactions that will address the Karabakh conflict. Viewing events in a war\\nin isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as\\nan act of Allied aggression! \\n \\n[AR] Dr. Alec Rasizade, senior research officer at the Academy of Sciences\\n[AR] of Azerbaijan, is a visiting researcher at the Harriman Institute of\\n[AR] Columbia University in New York.\\n\\nHa!\\n\\n \\n-- \\nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"Armenia has not learned a lesson in\\nS.D.P.A.

This report\\n  covers events through March 31, 1993.  The last report, dated\\n  November 10, 1992, covered events through October 15, 1992.\\n\\n       1.  There have been no amendments to the Iranian\\n  Transactions Regulations (\"ITRs\"), 31 CFR Part 560, or to the\\n  Iranian Assets Control Regulations (\"IACRs\"), 31 CFR Part 535,\\n  since the last report.\\n\\n       2.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"FAC\") of the\\n  Department of the Treasury continues to process applications\\n  for import licenses under the ITRs.  However, as previously\\n  reported, recent amendments to the ITRs have resulted in a\\n  substantial decrease in the number of applications received\\n  relating to the importation of nonfungible Iranian-origin goods.\\n\\n       During the reporting period, the Customs Service has\\n  continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin\\n  merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the import\\n  prohibitions of the ITRs.  FAC and Customs Service investi-\\n  gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions\\n  and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.  Additional\\n  forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review.\\n\\n       3.  The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the\\n  \"Tribunal\"), established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers\\n  Accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims\\n  before it.  Since the last report, the Tribunal has rendered\\n  12 awards, for a total of 545 awards.  Of that total, 367 have\\n  been awards in favor of American claimants:  222 of these were\\n  awards on agreed terms, authorizing and approving payment of\\n  settlements negotiated by the parties, and 145 were decisions\\n  adjudicated on the merits.  The Tribunal has issued 36 decisions\\n  dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing\\n  claims for jurisdictional reasons.  Of the 59 remaining awards,\\n  3 approved the withdrawal of cases, and 56 were in favor of\\n  Iranian claimants.  As of March 31, 1993, awards to successful\\n  American claimants from the Security Account held by the\\n  NV Settlement Bank stood at $2,340,072,357.77.\\n\\n       As of March 31, 1993, the Security Account has fallen\\n  below the required balance of $500 million 36 times.  Iran has\\n  periodically replenished the account, as required by the Algiers\\n  Accords, by transferring funds from the separate account held by\\n  the NV Settlement Bank in which interest on the Security Account\\n  is deposited.  Iran has also replenished the account with the\\n  proceeds from the sale of Iranian-origin oil imported into the\\n  United States, pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by-\\n  case basis by FAC.  Iran has not, however, replenished the\\n  account since the last oil sale deposit on October 8, 1992.\\n  The aggregate amount that has been transferred from the Interest\\n  Account to the Security Account is $874,472,986.47.  As of\\n  March 31, 1993, the total amount in the Security Account was\\n  $216,244,986.03, and the total amount in the Interest Account\\n  was $8,638,133.15.\\n\\n       4.  The Tribunal continues to make progress in the\\n  arbitration of claims of U.S. nationals for $250,000.00 or more.\\n  Since the last report, nine large claims have been decided.\\n  More than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been\\n  disposed of through adjudication, settlement, or voluntary\\n  withdrawal, leaving 76 such claims on the docket.  The larger\\n  claims, the resolution of which has been slowed by their\\n  complexity, are finally being resolved, sometimes with sizable\\n  awards to the U.S. claimants.  For example, two claimants were\\n  awarded more than $130 million each by the Tribunal in October\\n  1992.\\n\\n       5.  As anticipated by the May 13, 1990, agreement settling\\n  the claims of U.S. nationals for less than $250,000.00, the\\n  Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (\"FCSC\") has continued its\\n  review of 3,112 claims.  The FCSC has issued decisions in\\n  1,201 claims, for total awards of more than $22 million.  The\\n  FCSC expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining\\n  claims in early 1994.\\n\\n       6.  In coordination with concerned Government agencies,\\n  the Department of State continues to present United States\\n  Government claims against Iran, as well as responses by the\\n  United States Government to claims brought against it by Iran.\\n  In November 1992, the United States filed 25 volumes of\\n  supporting information in case B/1 (Claims 2 & 3), Iran\\'s claim\\n  against the United States for damages relating to its Foreign\\n  Military Sales Program.  In February of this year, the United\\n  States participated in a daylong prehearing conference in\\n several other cases involving military equipment.  Iran also\\n  filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure\\n  of U.S. courts to enforce an award against a U.S. corporation\\n  violated the Algiers Accords.\\n\\n       7.  As reported in November, Jose Maria Ruda, President of\\n  the Tribunal, tendered his resignation on October 2, 1992.  No\\n  successor has yet been named.  Judge Ruda\\'s resignation will\\n  take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up\\n  his duties.\\n\\n       8.  The situation reviewed above continues to involve\\n  important diplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the\\n  United States and its nationals.  Iran\\'s policy behavior\\n  presents challenges to the national security and foreign\\n  policy of the United States.  The IACRs issued pursuant to\\n  Executive Order No. 12170 continue to play an important role\\n  in structuring our relationship with Iran and in enabling\\n  the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords.\\n  Similarly, the ITRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12613\\n  continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter-\\n  national terrorism.  I shall exercise the powers at my disposal\\n  to deal with these problems and will report periodically to the\\n  Congress on significant developments.\\n\\n\\n                         WILLIAM J.

This impressive change in the province\\'s ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \\n (See also Map 1.

It is\\n[EE] also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism\\n[EE] and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period. \\n\\nThe vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or Armenian\\nApostolic.

While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian in\\ncertain areas of Cilician Armenia, most all Armenians spoke Armenian. In fact,\\nTurks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian! For sure, most all\\nArmenians, especially men, also knew Turkish in order to function in larger \\nsociety.\\n\\n[EE] My question is, given so many separations in the Armenian community, what\\n[EE] was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian\\n[EE] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century? As I stated, religion\\n[EE] was not uniform (unlike the Greeks) and many Armenians couldn\\'t even speak\\n[EE] Armenian. I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the\\n[EE] Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian \\n[EE] consciousness.\\n\\nThe Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian, regardless\\nof the specific branch of Christianity they professed. The resultant Armenian\\nnationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution. Even at the later \\nstages of WWI, and after the genocide, many Armenians who were converted to \\nIslam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems. This \\npractice continued well into the 1920s by Ataturk in parallel with the policy \\nof clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism. Many of these\\nconverted Armenians, ironically, in order to stay alive, were staunch Moslems. \\n\\n[EE] Any information will be appreciated.\\n\\nYou answered your own question!

However,\\n\\nThis is quite a misrepresentation.  After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims were\\nkilled and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder,\\nnot some fictitious \"supression of rebellion.\"  Even earlier, one can\\npoint to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of\\nMuslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to the\\nSerbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum \"The Expulsion of the\\nArnauts\" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic\\non March 7, 1937, in Belgrade:\\n\\n   The Mode of Removal\\n   -------------------\\n\\n   [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed\\n   through state terror and \"private initiative\", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ]\\n\\n   Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction.  We should\\n   distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik\\n   action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...]\\n   ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and,\\n   if need be, ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally, local riots can be\\n   incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the\\n   Chetniks, rather than the army.\\n\\n   There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL\\n   EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages\\n   and city quarters.\\n\\n(Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually\\nall Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorism\\nagainst Muslims, aided by Chetnik \"private initiative,\" has continued in WWII\\nand today.  For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book \"Od tradicije do \\nidentiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana\" (Sarajevo:\\nSvjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca\\nin WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explaining\\ntheir action as follows:\\n\\n   \"Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you\\n   are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us, we shall not\\n   torture you.\"\\n\\nso the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year, Serbs\\nhave repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destruction\\nof mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the\\neradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs.\\n\\n\\n>>I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda,\\n>>in fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seen\\n>>themselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly\\n>>relations.  Your suggestion that Croat-Muslim relationship is \\n>>anything like Serb-Muslim relationship is completely wrong.\\n>>\\n>>To say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply\\n>>they are not separate peoples.  ....\\n>\\n>\\tHow touching.

However \\n>\\tone of the main agendas is turning Bosnia into purely Catholic state.\\n\\nCroatia never had many Muslim citizens for historical reasons, because it\\nwas not a part of the Ottoman Empire.  The last major battles between\\nAustro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the\\nend of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism\\ncame into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as the\\nbest Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations \\nto Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian\\nnationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  As\\nfor your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim\\nalliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.  Arguments such as\\nyours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.  \\n\\n>\\tI should add few more things.  A.J.

Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats\\nand Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments are\\nunstable.  I\\'m working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and\\nMuslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed.  \\nYou are wrong if you think only \"image\" is at stake here.  Croatia has\\na deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa.  \\n\\nI think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice \\nat this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before \\nany open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia will\\nsurvive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse\\noff.  However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not\\nsee it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left?\\nIf not, then all bets are off.\\n\\nMr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this.  I\\'m deeply hurt.\\nThis is not about some \"image\" but about survival of a concept of a\\npartnership which I believe is natural and essential for both Croats\\nand Muslims.  \\n\\nSigh...\\nJosip\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The facts supported\\nBoomer\\'s contention that Atlantic Cement was wrongfully damaging his\\nproperty, and Boomer asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop\\ndoing so.  End of story.

Quite the contrary, I\\'d\\nprobably support the action, since it would be based on the same general\\ndoctrine as the decision that I believe would have been correct in\\n_Boomer_: the idea that people\\'s property rights should not be violated\\nfor reasons of economic efficiency.  In _Boomer_ it was Boomer\\'s\\nproperty rights which I believe the court should have protected; in the\\nhypothetical EPA ruling you\\'ve presented, it\\'s the American people\\'s\\ncollective property rights in a healthy physical environment.

Faced with situations in which the wrong has\\nalready been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place\\nand cannot be reversed or undone, courts will try to set an equitable\\nprice tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer\\nto pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might\\nprefer).  In these cases, the \"sale\" has already taken place and is\\nirreversible, and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is\\npaid, under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should\\neven a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and\\n(b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or\\ninequitable manner from his victimhood.  Both of these doctrines may be\\nworth discussing or debating elsewhere, but neither is relevant to cases\\nlike _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it\\nare still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone (i.e., prevented\\nfrom happening at all) by order of the court.\\n\\nIn these types of cases, all the court has to do is require that the\\npotential victim\\'s property rights are protected until and unless he\\nagrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price.  There is no need\\nfor the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both\\nsides to accept its finding.  It can leave that operation up to the\\nparties themselves.\\n\\n>> And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\n>> business of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\\n>> (If so, I\\'ve been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\\n>> supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\\n>\\n> Unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive.\\n\\nIn cases like _Boomer_, they\\'re simply a cost of doing business.  The\\nfact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co. got themselves into\\na position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a\\nresult of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant\\nwithout _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose\\nproperty rights they\\'d be violating via the operation of their plant.\\nThere\\'s nothing punitive or unjust about it.\\n\\n>> (2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\\n>> right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\\n>> losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\\n>> the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\\n>> not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\\n>> own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement\\'s wrongful acts.\\n>> [wdstarr]\\n>\\n> Anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire\\n> set of possessions to wronged person?  Weren\\'t you complaining about\\n> excess punitive damages before?\\n\\nAnybody who wants to commit a wrongful act in the future should be\\nrequired to buy the right to do so from the victim, in advance.

We \\ndo not agree. \\nA survey of U.S. Atmospheric scientists, conducted in the summer of 1991, \\nconfirms that there is  no consesensus about the cause of the slight warming \\nobserved during the past century.

Apparently acting\\n on information the Lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm, some thirty\\n agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) teamed up\\n with state and Tulsa police authorities, search warrant in hand, to\\n search for a \"Colt, AR-15, .223 caliber machine gun, unknown serial\\n number.\"  The warrant, issued by U.S. Magistrate John Leo Wagner, also\\n authorized agents to seize \"any tools used in the alteration or\\n modification of firearms, such as files or drills; documents, papers,\\n books, records, and other tangible properties which identify occupants\\n or owners of the property to be searched....\"\\n\\n    Reports vary, but according to neighbors, the joint task force\\n operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital\\n involved some 60 agents and local law enforcement personnel against\\n Lawmaster.  They cordoned off the street; took station with weapons\\n drawn in the back yard; used a battering ram to break through the\\n front door; kicked in the back door; broke into his gun safe; threw\\n personal papers around the house; spilled boxes of ammunition on the\\n floor; broke into a small, locked box that contained precious coins;\\n stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles, breaking the table\\n in the process.  Then, they left.  The doors were closed but not\\n latched, much less locked.  The ammo and guns were left unsecured.\\n\\n    \"My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted\\n through and couldn\\'t latch.  Anybody could have waltzed in there and\\n stolen everything I own.  A child could have taken a gun.  The guns,\\n the safe -- everything was open and laying around.  I keep all my\\n magazines empty, but someone had loaded them.  While I was looking\\n around in amazement, the gas, electric and water companies show up to\\n turn the power off.

I realize it is \\n> normally tossed out because it contains miracles, but what\\n> are the other reasons?\\n\\nFar from being \"tossed out,\" the gospels are taken, almost\\nuniversally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.\\nI am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who \"tosses out\"\\nthe New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,\\nbut the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb\\nascribes this more broadly.\\n\\nPerhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is\\nwhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far\\noutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels\\n*not* taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what\\nhappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and\\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\\nthis way by a critical reader.\\n\\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\\ntext as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect\\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\\nit bit him on the keister twice.\\n\\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\\nhave never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any\\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\\ntelling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way\\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\\nauthor\\'s history of whatever.)\\n\\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\\nthe text provide evidence?\\n\\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \\nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American\\nfigures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great\\nAmerican figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\\nThey are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi,\\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\\n\"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\\nthan teach history.\\n\\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\\nsubject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer\\'s \"Historian\\'s Fallacies\"\\nas a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy\\nto read texts present history.  It\\'s relatively cheap.  It\\'s easy\\nto read.  Give it a try.\\n\\nRussell\\n\\n',\n",

The Emperor, after the long and gruelling\\nstruggle, sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down.\\n\\nWith respect to my previous comments about David Koresh, I urge you\\nto re-examine my previous posts.  I believe you mistakenly assume\\nthat defense of Koresh\\' right to his own personal beliefs and his\\nright to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh\\'\\ntheology.  Actually I understand little about the details of Branch-\\nDavidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect\\nof the tragic events of the past few days.\\n\\nNor do I think Koresh\\' sex life should be of any interest to the\\nfederal government.  Of course Hillary says he had been molesting\\ninfants so it must be true even though such allegations do not\\nfall under the jurisdiction of the federal government; they are\\nstate and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the\\nlocal level by proper authorities with no successful charge having\\never been levied against him.  Under American law, he was innocent\\nas Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  At least\\nthat\\'s how it is suppposed to be.  But he was demonized and propa-\\ngandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a\\nlustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might\\nbring upon him.  \\n\\nBut evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children, who left the\\nbuilding in the early days of the siege,  were carefully examined\\nby qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse\\nand none was found.  DeGuerin, one of the attorneys who met with\\nDavidians several times before the conflagration, reported that\\nthe children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse.\\n\\nUltimately, Steve, what I think about the heart of David Koresh\\nis quite unimportant.  Today he is in the benevolent hands of a\\nmost wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all.\\nSo I withhold any judgment of David Koresh and defer to the One\\nwho has all knowledge.

Brian *IS* inside.  The Bible and the information contained therein\\nare outside the wall.   Brian Kendig proves this very sad fact by the\\nabsurd things he says.  For example, \"If I get through into the firey\\npit, I will cease to exist.\"  The Bible doesn\\'t say that.  He hasn\\'t\\na clue even to what Jesus said about hell.  That is but one example.\\n\\nNow in your sense, Kent, of sensing reality--that is a different\\nmatter.  And to you and to Brian, relativity does play a big role.\\nWhat we perceive to be true, depends on our vantage point.  Since I\\nhave read the Bible, and Brian Kendig shows that he hasn\\'t, he has \\na narrower perspective than mine  (at least in the respect\\nof knowledge of the Bible).   I am proposing to Brian, \"Brian, come up here\\nand take a look from this vantage point.\"   But Brian replies, \"I rather\\nnot thank you.  I am content where I am.  Besides, the vista from up\\nthere stinks.\"   And in the meanwhile, Brian ignores the facts that\\nhe has never up there nor does he realize I had shared the same\\nplateau where Brian now stands.\\n',\n",
