Its clear and concise code structure makes it highly readable and maintainable.\n","* **Extensive library support:** Python boasts a vast and comprehensive standard library that provides a wide range of modules for various tasks, including data analysis, machine learning, web development, and more. Additionally, there are numerous third-party libraries available, expanding its capabilities even further.\n","* **Interpreted language:** Python is an interpreted language, meaning that it executes code line by line without the need for compilation. This allows for rapid development and easy debugging.\n","* **Object-oriented:** Python supports object-oriented programming, enabling the creation of reusable and modular code. It allows for data encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n","* **Portability:** Python is cross-platform, meaning that code written in Python can run on multiple operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification.\n","* **Community support:** Python has a large and active community of developers, providing extensive support through documentation, forums, and online resources.\n","\n","**Cons of Python:**\n","\n","* **Slow execution speed:** Compared to compiled languages like C++ or Java, Python can be slower in execution due to its interpreted nature. This can be a limitation for performance-critical applications.\n","* **Memory consumption:** Python requires more memory than some other programming languages, as it stores variables dynamically. This can be an issue for large-scale applications or systems with limited resources.\n","* **Type flexibility:** Python allows for dynamic typing, which can lead to errors at runtime. While this flexibility can be convenient, it may result in unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.\n","* **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock):** Python uses a GIL, which prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously. This can limit the parallelism and scalability of multithreaded applications.\n","* **Limited mobile development:** Python is primarily designed for desktop and web development. While there are frameworks for mobile development, they may not be as mature or widely used as those for other languages like Java or Swift.\n"]}],"source":["# from langchain_google_genai import
