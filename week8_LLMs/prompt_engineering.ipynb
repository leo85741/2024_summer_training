of Python:**\n","\n","* **Readability and simplicity:** Python is known for its clean and intuitive syntax, making it easy to read, write, and maintain.\n","* **Versatility:** Python is a general-purpose language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, from web development to data analysis and machine learning.\n","* **Large community and support:** Python has a vast and active community, which provides extensive documentation, tutorials, and support resources.\n","* **Extensive library ecosystem:** Python has a rich collection of third-party libraries that extend its functionality for various tasks, such as data manipulation, web scraping, and machine learning.\n","* **Interpreted nature:** Python is an interpreted language, which means it can be executed line by line, making it easier for debugging and interactive development.\n","* **Cross-platform compatibility:** Python runs on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix, providing portability for your code.\n","\n","**Cons of Python:**\n","\n","* **Speed:** Python is generally slower than compiled languages like C or C++, especially for computationally intensive tasks.\n","* **Concurrency and parallelism:** Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits its ability to fully utilize multi-core processors for parallel processing.\n","* **Memory management:** Python uses automatic memory management, which can sometimes lead to memory leaks if not handled properly.\n","* **Type flexibility:** While Python's dynamic typing provides flexibility, it can also lead to potential type errors and challenges in debugging.\n","* **Limited low-level control:** Python does not offer direct access to low-level system resources, which can be a limitation in certain situations.\n","* **Package management issues:** Python's package management system can sometimes be complex and challenging to navigate, especially for beginners.\n"]}],"source":["# from

This is due to a missing XRESOLUTION and YRESOLUTION\\ntag which apparently is required (or at least believed to be required) for\\nvalid TIFF.  I have checked both xv 2.x and xv 3.x and neither of these\\ndo indeed copy these tags.\\n\\nHas anyone out there hacked in the fixes for xv to support these tags?\\nI have been told that I could find some code in tiff/tools/tiffcp.c, but\\nthat directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv.  I\\nhope to obtain the original tiff src and look at it, but would prefer\\nto find code already known to work in xv.\\n-- \\n:s \\n:s Larry W.

I have checked both xv 2.x and xv 3.x and neither of these\\ndo indeed copy these tags.\\n\\nHas anyone out there hacked in the fixes for xv to support these tags?\\nI have been told that I could find some code in tiff/tools/tiffcp.c, but\\nthat directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv.  I\\nhope to obtain the original tiff src and look at it, but would prefer\\nto find code already known to work in xv.\\n-- \\n:s \\n:s Larry W.

This is due to a missing XRESOLUTION and YRESOLUTION\\ntag which apparently is required (or at least believed to be required) for\\nvalid TIFF.  I have checked both xv 2.x and xv 3.x and neither of these\\ndo indeed copy these tags.\\n\\nHas anyone out there hacked in the fixes for xv to support these tags?\\nI have been told that I could find some code in tiff/tools/tiffcp.c, but\\nthat directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv.  I\\nhope to obtain the original tiff src and look at it, but would prefer\\nto find code already known to work in xv.\\n-- \\n:s \\n:s Larry W.

I have checked both xv 2.x and xv 3.x and neither of these\\ndo indeed copy these tags.\\n\\nHas anyone out there hacked in the fixes for xv to support these tags?\\nI have been told that I could find some code in tiff/tools/tiffcp.c, but\\nthat directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv.  I\\nhope to obtain the original tiff src and look at it, but would prefer\\nto find code already known to work in xv.\\n-- \\n:s \\n:s Larry W.

Virden)\\nOrganization: Nedriv Software and Shoe Shiners, Uninc.\\nLines: 16\\n\\n\\nRecently we have found TIFF manipulation packages which do not recognize\\nTIFF files output by xv.  This is due to a missing XRESOLUTION and YRESOLUTION\\ntag which apparently is required (or at least believed to be required) for\\nvalid TIFF.  I have checked both xv 2.x and xv 3.x and neither of these\\ndo indeed copy these tags.\\n\\nHas anyone out there hacked in the fixes for xv to support these tags?\\nI have been told that I could find some code in tiff/tools/tiffcp.c, but\\nthat directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv.  I\\nhope to obtain the original tiff src and look at it, but would prefer\\nto find code already known to work in xv.\\n-- \\n:s \\n:s Larry W.

I have checked both xv 2.x and xv 3.x and neither of these\\ndo indeed copy these tags.\\n\\nHas anyone out there hacked in the fixes for xv to support these tags?\\nI have been told that I could find some code in tiff/tools/tiffcp.c, but\\nthat directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv.  I\\nhope to obtain the original tiff src and look at it, but would prefer\\nto find code already known to work in xv.\\n-- \\n:s \\n:s Larry W.
